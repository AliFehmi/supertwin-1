Welcome to Super Twin's documentation!
======================================
Digital SuperTwin
SuperTwin creates a structured data representation over an HPC system, manages data input from a collection of tools and enable reasonings among them. Current capabilities of SuperTwin are:

- Monitoring
- Automated PMU configuration
- Automated profiling
- Modelling
- Knowledge retrieval

Overview

SuperTwin creates a Digital Twin Description (DTD) of a target system. It could be used to model, monitor and/or observe both a remote system or local system. However, since large amounts of data are sampled and visualized during the process best use case is to model a remote system.
Since SuperTwin leverages a large collection of tools; it has a large dependency list. Installation of these dependencies are left to the user.
